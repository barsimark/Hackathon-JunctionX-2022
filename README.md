# Hackathon-JunctionX-2022

## Have you ever had a problem with saving up for your dreams, or losing motivation at some point? Our solution is integrated into the Wise app to gamify the savings process by assigning a tree friend for you to help you on your journey.

### Create a new PlanT jar, and automate depositing
Customers make a savings jar in any desired currency and set a target they want to reach. Money can be added by setting a recurring transaction - for example, every week -, by a certain percentage after every purchase, or by direct deposit to the jar.

### Help your personal Tree Buddy grow while saving for your dreams
After creating the jar, a personal little tree buddy is received depending on the chosen currency. For example, if Japanese yen is chosen, a tiny cherry tree will help you on your journey. This tree can be raised by consistently saving money. Getting closer and closer to the goal grows your tree friend, but be careful, withdrawing money shrinks it every time. Who would want to do this?

### Get a discount while helping the environment
Reaching your target not only makes you and your virtual tree happy, but you also get a discount coupon from one of the partners of Wise, depending on the purpose of your savings. For example, if you are dreaming of a trip to Japan, a cheaper flight can come in handy. In addition, Wise can team up with other businesses and plant a real tree after every virtual one is successfully raised. You can fight deforestation by simply saving money!

### Who benefits from our solution?
All the Wise customers can take advantage of our solution as it enables them to save money without paying attention, to have a significantly better and more personal experience, and to help save our planet.

Wise benefits from this feature a lot, because it helps them understand customer habits, and saving targets, so a better service can be provided. Creating a strong bond with the customers can make Wise stand out in the competitive Fintech sector.

### Why this problem, and how to measure success?
We tackled this problem, because we see it often, especially among the youth. We would consider our project successful if the number of people saving money increased as a result of using our feature.
